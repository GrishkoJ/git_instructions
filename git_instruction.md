# GIT INSTRUCTION
## How to work with Git.
Git - is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Initialization of a new repository:
If you want to place a project under revision control, you should type the following command:

    git init

## Adding files:
If you want to add new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area, you should type the following command:

    git add

## Checking the status of the file:
If you want to check whether there exist some changes that you can add and commit (the command is extremely helpful when you are not sure whether you included something new to the file or whether you added it to Git), type:

    git status
